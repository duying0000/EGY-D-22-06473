# A Knowledge Guided DL Framework for Natural Gas Micro-Leaks Detection from HSI

# Project Description
This project introduces an improved physical model, named SAFY-NG, for the detection of underground natural gas micro-leaks. Additionally, a multi-branch image and spectrum combined vegetation growth estimation model (Img-Spec-PGE model) is proposed, utilizing near-surface Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) data to enhance vegetation health information. The simulated Leaf Area Index (LAI) from the Img-Spec-PGE model is then used as an intermediate variable for assimilating the SAFY-NG model, ultimately detecting underground natural gas micro-leaks under a knowledge-guided deep learning framework.

# Installation Guide
The SAFY model and its optimization algorithms are developed on the Matlab platform.
The Deep Learning (DL) model is based on the Python platform, utilizing the TensorFlow framework.
# Usage
As the experiments involved in this study are confidential and the original HSI data is excessively large, only a subset of spectral and image demo data suitable for the Img-Spec-PGE model is provided. For detailed processing methods, please refer to the original paper.
